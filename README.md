# Multichoice_quiz_challenge4

## Description

This project is meant to test a user's knowledge of Javascript with a multiple choice quiz. When started, the user will be presented with a question and four choices to it. Upon a wrong selection, they will lose some time from the timer and be given the chance to keep answering until correct. Once done, the user will be asked to save their name and the remaining time is recorded as their score.

This project was extremely challenging and frustrating on many levels. The concepts of local storage, and how to cycle through questions were my biggest hang-ups. I know I also could have done better with other aspects such as how my questions are shown and the overall presentation of my site, but I spent so much time on getting the logic and function to work, I was left demotivated to improve the looks.

I also know this project is of a much lower quality than I would like, but the will to keep trying at this particular one just isn't there anymore. It works and a basic level and I feel it meets much of the requirements and accept criteria that was asked of it. I just know it could be better.

## Credits

I want to give a lot of credit to both my instructor Robbert, as well as the tutor I had this week Cody, for helping me solve the many many issues I had doing this project. They were so understanding and helpful in walking me through the thought process (which I need to get better at) to break down the problems and solve them.
